To set up a cron job that runs the system health monitoring script every 60 seconds and sends an email with the health status, follow these steps:

Edit Your Script:
Make sure your Python script (the one we completed earlier) is saved in a location accessible by the cron job.
Open Terminal:
Open a terminal or command prompt on your system.
Edit Crontab:
Type the following command to edit your user’s crontab:
crontab -e

Add a New Cron Job:
In the crontab editor, add the following line to execute your script every 60 seconds:
* * * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/your/script.py

Replace /usr/bin/python with the actual path to your Python interpreter (you can find it using which python).
Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the actual path to your Python script.
Save and Exit:
Save the changes and exit the crontab editor.
Verify:
To verify that the cron job is set up correctly, you can list your current cron jobs:
crontab -l

You should see the line you added.
Test:
Wait for a minute, and your script should execute automatically. Check the console output or logs to ensure it’s working as expected.
If there are any issues, you’ll receive an email (if configured correctly).
Remember to replace placeholders like /usr/bin/python and /path/to/your/script.py with the actual values. Additionally, ensure that your SMTP server configuration is accurate for sending emails.

Your system will now monitor health status and send alerts via email at regular intervals
